Some kinda badly written script. 
The main character is abducted by certain governmental agency for some kinda weird experiments. In this case, he was plugged into ( along with other group of people ) a machine that 
simulates virtual world. When he wakes up, he has no idea what's going on and how he got here. After certain period of time he starts seeing certain
glimpses of random code hanging around... well everywhere and he kinda then decided to go ahead and figure out the code. After a certain while, he encounters
bunch of 'programs' ( Agent Smith anyone? ) that are hostile. Every time he kills one their code mutates.  After figuring out the code and the meaning 
behind the code, he wakes up in real world... and then he is killed. That government man, should't trust it. THE END. 



Virtual world concept.
You are looking for a way to get out.
Travel in the world and come across pieces of code that you have to solve.
The resistance movement that will get you gold for solving certain code.
Gold will allow you to get certain items that simplify problem solving / decelerate the rate at which player param drops if the player answers incorrectly
/ restore player params ( potions - like objects )  
After solving first couple of problems you encounter enemies ( functions ( or local paradoxes )  ) that are unskippable
and every incorrectly answered question in this case will lower your health parameter. Questions will have to be rather simple in this case. 
An ability to talk to certain characters. 

Player params:
- Stamina - every incorrectly answered question will decrease stamina.
- Intelligence - every correctly answered question will increase stamina. 
- Health - self explanatory.
